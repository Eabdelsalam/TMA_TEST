# TranscriptMetaAnalyst

### A graphical user interface to meta-analyze RNA-Seq transcriptomics data

This app is designed to help biologists with less programming skills to perform meta-analysis of several transcriptomic RNA-Seq-generated data sets in order to get robust results and new insights into the data that was generated by their own studies or the data available online.

## Installation

The app could be installed locally via [GitHub](https://github.com/Eabdelsalam/TransciptMetaAnalyst) using the following commands (please note that `BiocManager` and `devtools` packages should be installed before installing the app):


1. Check if devtools and BiocManager are installed, and install them if not
`if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}`
`if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}`


2. Use `devtools` to install the ShinyApp
`devtools::install_github("Eabdelsalam/TranscriptMetaAnalyst")`


3. Finally, run the app
`shiny::shinyAppDir(system.file(package = "TranscriptMetaAnalyst"))`
